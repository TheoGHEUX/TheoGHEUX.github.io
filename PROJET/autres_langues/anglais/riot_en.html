                experiences, often focused on competition and eSports. The company has

            <h2>The founders of Riot Games</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill are the co-founders of Riot Games. Longtime friends, 
                they shared a passion for video games and envisioned a unique approach: developing 
                high-quality competitive multiplayer games while adopting a "free-to-play" business 
                model, which was still rare at the time.

                Their vision came to life with the launch of League of Legends in 2009, which quickly 
                became one of the most popular games in the world, bringing together millions of 
                players and spectators. Under their leadership, Riot Games also played a major role 
                in the rise of esports, organizing international competitions followed by millions of 
                fans.
                
                In 2017, Beck and Merrill decided to step down from daily operations to focus on 
                creative projects and the development of new games, while remaining deeply involved 
                in the long-term vision of Riot Games.

                <h2>Riot Games' role in Arcane</h2>
                Riot Games played a central role in the creation of Arcane, an animated adaptation 
                of the League of Legends universe. In collaboration with the French animation studio 
                Fortiche Production, Riot Games oversaw every step of the creative process to ensure 
                the series remained true to the identity and depth of its universe. The goal was to 
                bring the stories and iconic characters of the game to life, while exploring universal 
                themes such as power struggles, family bonds, and moral dilemmas.

                Riot Games also contributed its narrative expertise by enriching the character arcs 
                and developing the complex relationships between them, particularly those of Jinx, Vi, 
                and Jayce. By investing directly in the production rather than licensing its rights to a third party, Riot ensured that Arcane stayed true to its artistic vision and lore*, while providing an immersive and accessible experience, even for those unfamiliar with the game. This attention to detail made Arcane both a critical and popular success, further strengthening Riot Games' influence beyond the video game industry.                <br><br>
                <i>Lore*: refers to the collection of stories, narratives, myths, and narrative elements that make up the fictional universe of a work.
